# Burn-the-bridges
A renpy visual novel type game
Developers and graphic artists are very needed.Sound artists are also welcome.
NOTE:ALL THE GRAPHICS ARE PLACEHOLDERS

Here is a very short rundown of what I plan for it:
The first chapter would be to get to know the 2 main characters(one being female the other male). After that the player would decide with which one to play(with slight hints to a backstory). The second one would be the introduction of the various different clubs.Each club would be a route for a different character,and the found your own club route would end up with the two characters ending up with each other.So far I am thinking about a computer club,historical fencing,literature and 2 or 3 more routes/clubs.I would maybe even split those into subroutes?Out of all the endings I would want to have at least one or two shoujo ai endings.I could also be talked into making shounen ai endings(especially if a team member would write those instead of me).
Although I could be talked into making it an actual ecchi or hentai game I did not plan to do that for this game.This game would have been kissing and cuddling at the most with sex maybe hinted at.
As you may have noticed I would prefer to make a visual novel that would not have a marathon huge story but would have loads of choices for the explorers.(So you could finish it in about a day,but you could explore it for weeks.)
Both the characters would start of with kind of vigilante personalities.The game would have good bad and "troll" endings.
